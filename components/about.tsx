              At Marga Cheetah Manufacturer (MCM), we believe that great clothing starts with great partnerships.
              Founded in 1997 by Endy Butun, we've grown from a local Jakarta workshop into an international garment
              manufacturer specializing in children's apparel â€” with a strong focus on girls' fashion.
